News Feed

Firebase CloudStore

Android(Java)

Volley - API Requests

Challenges Faced:
The kept throwing back 403 errors for all  the news components.
The free plan does not allow for use outside a development environment i.e localhost.
The API was therefore unable to fetch data.

Setting firebase can be quite long with lower versions of android and this is a challenge I also faced.

Feedback:
The test was well set and all primary areas of software develpment.
